This is a version of weather console app that I already had.
Continuing on master brach.

#####################################################################
This is a weather app created as part of the UDEMY course on Node.js
https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/overview

Using google maps geocode API and Darksky.net API.

Geocode API returns a coordinates from address.
Darksky API returns current weather data based on coordinates.


All you need is darksky.net API key, add it to the config-example.js and rename to config.js
Then npm install
